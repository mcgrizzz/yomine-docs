## Dependencies

Yomine works best alongside a few other tools. You can install these **before or after** installing Yomine.

## Installation

<Steps>

1. Download the latest release <LatestReleaseBadge />

   <LatestReleaseTabs />

2. Run your downloaded binary

   ![Setup incomplete banner in Yomine](/src/assets/initial_setup.webp)

   <Aside title="First launch" icon="starlight">
     Yomine will install the tokenizer and a frequency dictionary.
   </Aside>

3. Setup Integrations

    If these are not complete, there will be banner at the top of the screen which says `Setup Incomplete.` You can click it for an overview of what must be done.

    If mpv or asbplayer is running, yomine will automatically detect it so no further setup is required.

    Anki:
    Make sure Ankiconnect is setup and anki is running. 
    In the setup checklist click `Setup Anki` or go to `Settings` > `Anki`

    For each notetype you want to use:
    Select the notetype, then make sure the term field and reading field is set correctly. Yomine will try to automatically detect these, but you may override the selections if you want.
    Click add.
    Click save settings

    Setup is now complete.

4. Open a subtitle file by clicking 'Open New File' or dragging it into Yomine.
